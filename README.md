# WordPress Admin Command Palette

Optimize WordPress admin navigation with a modal window to search for and navigate directly to WordPress admin pages.

## Features

The Admin Command Palette (ACP) is a modal window in the WordPress Admin that live searches admin content, which saves you many clicks and page loads. You can:

* Search for and navigate to user-generated content (Posts, Pages, Users, etc.).
* Search for and navigate to WordPress Admin Pages (All Posts, Add New Post, etc.).
* Perform WordPress Admin actions via the modal window or a keyboard shortcut (Publish, Add Media, View Post, etc.).

This plugin brings about a new level of efficiency to WordPress admin user interactions: it's like the difference between going over a mountain via a pass, versus going through a mountain via a tunnel. The tunnel is always more direct, more efficient, and more straightforward than the pass.

## Basic Usage

Install the plugin and hit the keyboard shortcut "shift+shift" to trigger the modal window. The live search box will match results via fuzzy search logic. You can dismiss the modal by hitting escape, "shift+shift" again, or by clicking the modal overlay.

## Admin Shortcuts

The ACP also comes with some built-in keyboard shortcuts to make actions in the WordPress admin easier. You do not need to open the ACP in order to use the shortcuts.

| Shortcut | Action                    |
|----------|---------------------------|
| *␛*     | Clear input focus         |
| *⇧+s*    | Primary button click      |
| *⇧+p*    | Preview                   |
| *⇧+t*    | Trash                     |
| *⇧+v*    | Open Post/Page in New Tab |
| *⇧+n*    | Add New Post/Page         |
| *⇧+f*    | Set Featured Image        |
| *→*      | Pagination: next page     |
| *←*      | Pagination: previous page |
| *⇧+→*    | Pagination: last page     |
| *⇧+←*    | Pagination: first page    |

## Installation

Upload the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory. Activate in the WordPress Admin.
