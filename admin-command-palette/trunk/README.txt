Makes the WordPress Admin Search, Navigation and Actions user experience faster and more intuitive.

== Description ==

The Admin Command Palette (ACP) is a modal window in the WordPress Admin that live searches admin content, which saves you many clicks and page loads. You can:

* Search for and navigate to user-generated content (Posts, Pages, Users, etc.).
* Search for and navigate to WordPress Admin Pages (All Posts, Add New Post, etc.).
* Perform WordPress Admin actions via the ACP or a keyboard shortcut (Publish, Add Media, View Post, etc.).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `admin-command-palette` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Use the keyboard shortcut "shift+shift" to activate the Admin Command Palette.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The ACP compares the search term against titles, e.g., a post title, an admin page title, or an admin action title.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
